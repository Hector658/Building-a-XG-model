In order to apply our model we made a complete analysis of the season 2018-2019, particularly for Messi in what was one of his best seasons individually.

## Matches

Using the data provided by Statsbomb we filtered the events of the above mentioned season
and these events were filtered for the matches of Barcelona.

## Passes

Filtering the passes event we calculated the total amount of passes made by Messi, including completes and no completes
allowing us to calculate the percentage of succesful passes.

## Assists

Using the data of the passes we made an analysis of the passes ended in goal, but this is not all, we plot these assists
and made a comparison with 
all the other players in La Liga, and there were no one player with more assists.


## Shots

Messi performed many shots, whose were plot in a pitch using the module mplsoccer 

Defining a function with the dimensions of the goal, we made a filter to know when the shots go on target or off target, and whose of those shots were goals


## Goals

We already plot the goals, but going further we made an analysis for the rivals he scored.
Previously we defined the Rival function, now we can use it to know how many and to which opponent
he scored more goals.
