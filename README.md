# Building-a-xG-model

## 


Expected goal (xG) model is a statistical method used to measure the quality of scoring opportunities in football (soccer).
It assigns a probability value between 0 and 1 to each shot taken during a match, based on factors such as the location of the shot, the type of shot, and the situation leading up to the shot. 
The higher the xG value of a shot, the more likely it is to result in a goal. 

The main factors to consider in this model are the distance to goal and the angle of the shot, formed by the position of the ball at the time of
the shot and the posts of the goal.
